This convenience API for IHE transactions and CDA documents allows easy access and conformity to eHealth affinity
domains. The project is based on a country independent architecture, but implements also Swiss extensions. Other country
extensions are possible, your contributions are welcome.

The latest Javadoc is published on <a href="https://project-husky.github.io/husky/">project-husky.github.io/husky</a>
and the documentation is available in the [wiki](https://github.com/project-husky/husky/wiki).

## Integration in Projects

The generated maven artefacts are located in a maven repository and can easily integrated into your maven project by
adding the corresponding dependency in your dependency management.
i.e.

```
<dependencyManagement>
  <dependencies>
    <dependency>
      <groupId>org.projecthusky.communication</groupId>
      <artifactId>husky-communication-gen</artifactId>
      <version>2.0.0</version>
    </dependency>
  </dependencies>
  ...
</dependencyManagement>

<dependencies>
  <dependency>
    <groupId>org.projecthusky.communication</groupId>
    <artifactId>husky-communication-gen</artifactId>
    <version>2.0.0</version>
  </dependency>
  ...
</dependencies>
```

You have to add the repository information into your pom too.

```
